* It was summer and the sun was shining brightly
 the school has ended what a fine day to take a nap*

* I was about to sleep but then a cute girl 
 was coming in my direction*


* [girl] Hello this is strange thing to ask you 
 right now but you look very familiar.*

* [you] Oh really now that i think about it 
 you look familiar too.*

* That time i kinda freeze for a moment
 and realized that i definitely know that girl.* 

* [you] Are you by any chance Sonia 
 from middle school.* 

* [Sonia] Yes that's my name and you have
 to be kostas right?*
 
* [kostas] It's been so long since the last time 
 we talk, that was so sudden to meet you here.*

* Then she gives me a sudden hug and i freeze again
 like i was on middle school or something.*

* I mean she was way too beautiful in that distance
 i can't really help it*

* [Sonia] Im so happy to meet you again but 
 i need to take the bus now.*

* [kostas] yea no problem i dont want you to lose it.*

* too bad that the good things end quickly,
 i hope to see her again.*

* [Sonia] see ya kostas that was fun.*

* [kostas] goodbye Sonia.*

* and she left..
 but i think i forgot something..*

* WAIT! i dont have anything to stay in contact with 
 her, i think i can reach her in time.*

* so she went to the bus station
 but to the left side of the road.*

* wait this is not right i take the bus too to come 
 here but the bus station is on the right side.*

* i gess the have two bus stations,
 anyway i have to hurry.*

* i was running for 5 minutes and then 
 i see a bus station, i think.*

* but as i get closer and closer i see that 
 this was an old station.*

* [kostas] i dont get it..*

* where did she go? 
 she just vanish..*
